# Haskell stdin/stdout scripts

## Learn haskell with coding challenges

Created to learn the basics of Haskell

## Setup

1. Copy the `starter` directory and rename it whatever you want.
2. Write a program.
3. Run it with `input.txt | ./Main`.
3. a. Run it with `input.txt | ./Main >> output.txt` to write to the output.

## What this gets you

* `Main.hs` A starter script that reads from stdin and writes to stout.
* `input.txt` A file to put your test input.
* `output.txt` An output file if you need it.
* `.ghci` A file so you can run ghcid from the script directory.
